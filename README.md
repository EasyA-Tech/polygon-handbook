## Handy Code Snippets

Get a taste of Polygon development with these code snippets:

### Connecting to Polygon

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');

const web3 = new Web3('https://polygon-rpc.com/');
console.log('Connected to Polygon');
```

### Deploying a simple ERC20 token

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

These examples showcase:
1. How to connect to the Polygon network using Web3.js.
2. A simple ERC20 token contract that can be deployed on Polygon.
